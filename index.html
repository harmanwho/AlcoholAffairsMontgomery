              Alcohol has maintained a large and crucial component in human affairs throughout history. On both social and economic scales, the use and distribution of alcohol are very influential forces. Thus, analyzing data relevant to the sale and any potential related violations can provide insights relevant to a location's economic and social affairs in the context of alcohol. In specific, using our various datasets that include information regarding the alcohol supply chain and the validity and reliability of alcohol sales over time, we can draw answers to the following example general questions:

With a world full of wide varieties of different products and services, delivering variety as well as quality is the key to success when it comes to generating revenue. At the heart of this analysis, the goal is to gain insight into consumer behavior and what will lead to the most popular choices.

                    <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                      While there is no correlation specifically betweenn Fulfilled Quantity and Fulfilled date, we do see small clusters form like on the 23rd where there were a lot of orders that took longer to order. This means that the backlog within the specific clusters might have more to do with the type of alcohol that is being made.
                      <strong>We can see that with the hover, all of the dots that seem to be related to Wine.</strong>

                    <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                    This makes a lot of sense given that Montgomery County is one of the wealthiest counties in the united states, the larger wait times would make sense with more expensive types of wine. Traditionally, more expensive wines are also more aged, and thus ahrder to make. And if those wines are shipped from outside the US or sourced by complex methods, lots of proceedures to ensure the quality of the wine and avoiding damages to the bottles while shipping could be a priority that adds to the wait time.

                    <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                    In terms of units sold, Wine clearly stands out apart from the rest, with Beer coming in around about only half the units sold that wine has, and more than kegs, liquor and Non-Alcohol combined. This makes sense with the fact that Montgomery county is again, one of the wealthiest counties within the US. Wine can be on the expenseive side of the market when taking into account the rarety of the wine, as well as it's age. Hard Liquor is a commodity that is usually on the cheaper side than beer, and non-alcohol obiously would not appeal to those who are looking for some level of intoxication.
                    </li>
                  <li>
                    <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                    It is also important to note that since there are still implementations of social distancing in place, it makes sense that Kegs might not be selling as well due to the fact it is alcohol in bulk. Kegs would be ideal for large gatherings, which are incredibly limited during the period in which this analysis is being conducted.

                    <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                    Beer sold in either a 12 OZ or 4/6 cans tend to be the most popular. Unflavored beers still maintain a presence such as Abita Strawberry, and 21st hell or high watermelon. However, there is also a lot more polarizing sales between beers that do not have flavor. It seems consumers have a preferred unflavored beer, with lots of variance of people choosing different flavored beers.
                    </li>
                  <li>
                    <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                    Given that these are special orders, it makes sense that the results would be all the more polarizing. If business routinely stick to ordering from trusted corporations that they have long standing relationships with, then there has to be a significant reason for them to make the switch.

                    The Cooper's Hawk brand has at least three different products within the top ten selling wines. Grape wine in particular seems to be a popular choice among many consumers as many different suppliers make grape flavored wine. However, Cooper's Hawk Below The Belt 750ML wine bottle is by far sells the most units by nearly double the second leading wine. This makes sense that the main leader of sales within the conty would also be able to sell lots of volume in regards to other products as well.

                  <li>
                    <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                    This is because Cooper's Hawk has established themselves as a reliable vendor to buyers of their product. So if they decide to innovate and create more variety within their products, their consumers will be much more likely to trust them over a lesser well known competitor. Given that wine is traditionally made from grapes, it also makes sense that grap flavored wine would be a popular choice for many different wine suppliers because it would be easier to make.

                  Example Insight and Hypothesis
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>In Montgomery, certain kinds of violations occur more frequently than others, and violations of the same nature tend to have the same dispositions.</strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                    In this visualization, the 5 most frequently occuring violations are portrayed. To see the resulting penalty (disposition) to the offense, hover over the bars. Clearly, the sale of alcohol to minors is the most frequent violation, occuring more than twice the other following violations, at over 350 incidents. The next highest, also in a similar category of unlawful activity, is the lack of certified employees on the premises. The next 3 violations are all relatively common in that they are more so bureaucratic violations: less exciting infractions such as invoice violations, unavailable employee records, and unsatisfactory license displays.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                    As evident through the dispositions, selling alcohol to underage customers carries the heaviest penalty, also by a wide margin: The resulting disposition is a fine of $1000 in most cases, double the second highest fine listed. Interestingly, the records - related violations also seem to pack a hefty punch, with fines of $500 in the majority of instances.

                <p>
                  <strong>The pandemic has had a measurable effect on the nature, frequency, and response to alcohol violations in Montgomery.</strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                    It is certainly a peculiar situation that Montgomery facilities seem to violate the most costly and serious enforcement most often; it seems as though the underage population of Montgomery can help themselves quite easily to a drink or two at these businesses. To get a better sense of what may be going on, this visualization focuses solely on sale-to-minor violations over time. Incidents listed after 2020 (post-covid) are represented with red.
                    </li>
                  <li>
                    <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                    The visualization provides multiple takeaways. Firstly, there seems to be a discernible wave-like trend in these violations over time: summer months tend to have far fewer instances, while autumn tends to begin with a sharp rise, decreasing over time until the summer. Secondly, unsurprisingly, covid-era months tend to have fewer incidents of underage sale, with large gaps in the summer and fall/winter months.

                <p>
                  <strong>Alcohol types with the most number of Orders(Wine and Beer) have more consistent fulfillments as compared to Alcohol types with less number of Orders.</strong>
                </p>

                  <li>
                    <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                    As observed in the charts below by clicking on 'Beer' and 'Wine' alcohol types, it is seen that although the orders are placed everyday consistently over the month, the fulfillments of the orders are accomplished starting Wednesdays and ending Sundays during the week.
                    </li>
                  <li>
                    <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                    Except for 'Beer' and 'Wine' the fulfillments are scattered all over the week from which it can be concluded that the suppliers tend to focus on more organized and timely deliveries for 'Wine' and 'Beer' orders even when the Order quantity is low because overall orders for the mentioned types of alcohol are high.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>
                    It can be said that there is improved and more stable delivery and fulfillment system established for certain types of alcohol given the overall demand for the mentioned.

                <p>
                  <strong>Zipcodes with On Premise Establishments consisting of more than 90% of all establishments have a higher percentage of Suspension Violations.</strong>

                    For a more drilled-down analysis; as seen in the grouped bar charts the types of Premises and the type of violations can be simultaneously compared among the charts. This indicates the On Premise type establishments are more likely to do serious violations.
